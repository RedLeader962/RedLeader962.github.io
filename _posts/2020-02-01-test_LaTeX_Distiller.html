<p class="">
We are now left with the following unanswered questions:
</p>

<p class="distiller-lead text-center">
<strong>Why</strong> choose a design &amp; architecture over another?<br/>How do I recognize <strong>when</strong> an implementation detail becomes impactful or critical?
</p>

<p class="">
I don’t think there is a single answer to those questions and gaining experience at implementing DRL algorithm might probably help, but it’s also clear that none of those questions can be answered without doing a proper assessment of the settings.
